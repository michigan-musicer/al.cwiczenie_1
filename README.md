# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLASS

Download all files in this repository and upload them to a CodeBlocks project. Fill in the blanks in `exercise_1.c`. When you are done, call Kevin over so that he can check your work. (If we run out of time before Kevin can check your work, feel free to send an email to kwang@al.edu.pl with your completed code.)

If you would like to run these files in a Unix environment outside of CodeBlocks, you can run `make exercise_1` in the command line. This will compile and execute your program for you. You will need to ensure that `make` and `gcc` are both installed in your environment. 

Solution file will be uploaded after class, exact time / date TBD.
